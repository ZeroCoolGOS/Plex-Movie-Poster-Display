# Docker Setup

## Information

This docker image is based on the latest [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) docker official image.

Once the image is built the size of the image is about 265MB,  with a change to the base image this size could come down in the future.

The Dockerfile has been composed based on the instructions within the [Setup Local](Setup_local.md) file (_with a few liberations_).

Because this system creates a image based on a baseline state, we can take a few "shortcuts" to automate the process a bit.

Both nginx config files (with changes pre-applied) are included within this repo and are copied in during the `docker build` process.

Where a standard replace could be simply done, that process was used to keep true to the setup instructions.

Since this image is being built from within the code repo, a git clone was not used and the core application was copied in.

**Workarounds:**
Due to how docker is designed as a single service container we have created a service wrapper to start multiple services when the image starts (nginx and php).

If you are familiar with docker these instructions should be very basic.

## Pre Requirements
Following the [Get Started with Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) would be a good start if you need to familiarize yourself with docker.
### Linux
- Installation instructions coming soon.
### Windows
- Installation of Docker Desktop for Windows can be found [here](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe).
### macOS
- Installation of Docker Desktop for macOS can be found [here](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg).

## Build
    docker build -t {image Name} .

## Run
    docker run -d -p 80:80 -- {container Name} {image name}

## Docker Build (Simplified):
We have created a set of scripts to automate the creation and run process of the docker image.

### Python
    cd build    
    py ./DockerSetup.py --port 80 --build --run
### PowerShell
    Coming Soon

## Future Plans:
- To create a public docker image with latest build that can just be installed from docker hub.
