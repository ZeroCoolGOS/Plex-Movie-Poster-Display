# Font Configuration
Plex Movie Poster now supports the use of custom fonts.

_**Note:** **php-zip** has been recently added as a system requirement (v2.7 - Feb. 2021)_

## Importing Fonts
To import your own font, navigate to the Font Configuration page.

In the "Import Font or Bundle" option, select "Browse File", and select your desired font/font bundle.

_Currently this system supports ".zip" and ".ttf" file formats for fonts_

If you select a zip file, the system will extract the files and folders within and store them in a cache folder.  This will allow for the quicker import of bundles of fonts.

When fonts are imported they will be display a sample of each font loaded.  

## Exporting Fonts
To export the currently installed custom fonts.  Select the "Generate Bundle" and a link to a zip file that includes all installed custom fonts will be made available.

This allows for a quick backup of the fonts you have installed, and can be used as a restore bundle for the "Import Fonts".


## Using Fonts
Once fonts have been imported a dropdown list of the fonts will be available within the "Coming Soon", "Now Playing", and "Custom Configuration" pages (under the Advanced settings).

These fonts will be available individually for the top and bottom text.

A font can be set but not used.  To activate the font the "Use Custom Font" option must be selected.
